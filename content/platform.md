## Basics

Vinli Platform Service:

*authenticates your application, Vinli device and
*configures pagination

Authentication using OAUTH 2 is mandatory for all Vinli apps. Apps must authenticate themselves and user actions to use Vinli services.

Vinli paginates data using:
* resource lists for static resources, or
* streams for rapidly changing data

Pagination can alter the format of dates and times. Itâ€™s an important topic for apps that rely on telemetry data.
